# Solar System Simulation in Pygame

## What I've done
I've succesfully translated Newton's universal gravitational equation to this, not quite accurate, simulation. I'm proud what of what I've done here and I think it truly represent my capabilities. The simulation contains the basic **8** planets plus **the Sun**.

## What I hope to implement
Maybe more constant orbits.
